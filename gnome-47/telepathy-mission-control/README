Telepathy Mission Control

Mission Control-or MC for short-is a Telepathy component implementing
both the Account Manager and Channel Dispatcher specifications. It
stores your IM account settings, deals with talking to the relevant
connection managers to bring accounts online where necessary, and
dispatches incoming and outgoing communication channels to the
relevant applications.
