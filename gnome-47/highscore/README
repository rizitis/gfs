Games is a GNOME 3 application to browse your video games library and to
easily pick and play a game from it. It aims to do for games what Music
already does for your music library.
You want to install Games if you just want a very simple and comfortable
way to play your games and you donâ€™t need advanced features such as
speedrunning tools or video game development tools.
