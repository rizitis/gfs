# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-tzlocal: tzlocal 4.0 also adds an official function get_localzone_name()
python3-tzlocal: to get only the timezone name, instead of a timezone object.
python3-tzlocal: On unix, it can raise an error if you don't have a timezone
python3-tzlocal: name configured, where get_localzone() will succeed, so only use that
python3-tzlocal: if you need the timezone name.
