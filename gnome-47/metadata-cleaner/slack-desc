# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

metadata-cleaner: Metadata within a file can tell a lot about you. Cameras record data 
metadata-cleaner: about when and where a picture was taken and which camera was used. 
metadata-cleaner: Office applications automatically add author and company information 
metadata-cleaner: to documents and spreadsheets. This is sensitive information and you 
metadata-cleaner: may not want to disclose it. This tool allows you to view metadata in 
metadata-cleaner: your files and to get rid of it, as much as possible.
