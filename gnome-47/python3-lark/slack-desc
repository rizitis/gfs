# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

python3-lark:
python3-lark: Lark is a parsing toolkit for Python, built with a focus on
python3-lark: ergonomics, performance and modularity. Lark can parse all
python3-lark: context-free languages.  To put it simply, it means that it is capable
python3-lark: of parsing almost any programming language out there, and to some
python3-lark: degree most natural languages too.
