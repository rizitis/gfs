malcontent implements support for restricting the type of content accessible to
non-administrator accounts on a Linux system. Typically, when this is
used, a non-administrator account will be for a child using the system; and the
administrator accounts will be for the parents; and the content being filtered
will be apps which are not suitable for the child to use, due to (for example)
being too violent.
