Subject: [PATCH 1/3] status/keyboard: Add a catch around reload call

Now that system input settings can get used in the user session
they're getting seen by the tests and the tests are complaining:

Unhandled promise rejection. To suppress this warning, add an
error handler to your promise chain with .catch() or a try-catch block
around your await expression.

This commit adds the catch it's asking for.
