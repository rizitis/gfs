# HOW TO EDIT THIS FILE:
# The "handy ruler" below makes it easier to edit a package description.
# Line up the first '|' above the ':' following the base package name, and
# the '|' on the right side marks the last column you can put a character in.
# You must make exactly 11 lines for the formatting to be correct.  It's also
# customary to leave one space after the ':' except on otherwise blank lines.

deja-dup: Déjà Dup is a simple backup tool. It hides the complexity of backing 
deja-dup: up the Right Way (encrypted, off-site, and regular) and uses 
deja-dup: duplicity as the backend. Déjà Dup focuses on ease of use and 
deja-dup: recovering from personal, accidental data loss. If you need a full 
deja-dup: system backup or an archival program, you may prefer other backup apps.
